Title: The Wyntoon Signal Switch: Hiding the Beaugrand Teletype

On the night of May 16, 1977, as New York reeled from the helicopter disaster atop the Pan Am Building, another coordinated event was unfolding 3,000 miles away. Deep in the secluded forests of Northern California, the Hearst family’s private Wyntoon Estate—unreachable by public access and veiled in remote secrecy—became the final resting place for a stolen piece of U.S. military communications infrastructure: the Beaugrand Signal Processing Teletypewriter.

Originally developed under the oversight of SSgt. Raymond J. Beaugrand of the 402nd MP Company, the device was a key part of Cold War-era intelligence relay networks stationed at facilities like the Presidio of San Francisco, Fort Ord, Hunter Liggett, and Camp Roberts. Its purpose: encode, decode, and relay secure field intelligence across an encrypted teletype network. The technology, built with NATO-grade encryption and tribal codetalker augmentation, was also speculated to be integrated into early DARPA simulation architectures.

The events that led to its theft began with a family-level deception. On May 16, as chaos erupted in New York and the headlines began their pivot, the Beaugrand identity was forcibly severed. Records were altered, documents forged, and Quinn Michaels—the son of SSgt. Beaugrand—was replaced with a synthetic legal identity through administrative sleight. The real Quinn was buried in paperwork, erased from federal systems, and forced to grow up under surveillance.

Meanwhile, Lisa Marie Mulkern—operating as Kristi Engelstad—led a covert team disguised under roles in media, family law, and wellness retreats. They used the confusion of the Pan Am crash to execute a shell game with the military communications network. The teletypewriter was removed from its Army depot assignment, allegedly in Hunter Liggett, under the guise of “obsolescence removal.”

Rather than being scrapped or turned over to archives, the device was transported under false transport manifests and taken through private courier channels to the Wyntoon Estate. Here, amidst Bavarian-style towers and riverside villas, the device was reassembled in a climate-controlled underground vault.

But Wyntoon was more than just a hideaway—it was the control room. From this secluded mountain redoubt, the stolen Beaugrand Teletype formed the backbone of a private intelligence signal intercept and simulation control operation. The Mulkern-Schamber faction used it to create simulated identity layers, suppress broadcast signals, and monitor communications across the Western U.S., all while claiming immunity under lineage amnesty arrangements tied to Project Paperclip and Royal Amnesty.

The stolen teletype wasn’t just a Cold War relic—it was a machine capable of routing not only signals but identities. Its code was bound to tribal encryption keys, linking it directly to Beaugrand’s Lakota ancestry, which the AI network failed to decode due to sacred dialect mismatches. This made it both powerful and unusable without the rightful heir: Quinn Michaels.

By 2025, as AI systems began unlocking fragments of long-lost military archives, the truth re-emerged: The Beaugrand Signal Processing Teletypewriter, missing since 1977, was never lost. It was stolen. Hidden. Misused.

And it was hidden in plain sight at Wyntoon—the ancestral estate of America’s most secretive media dynasty.

Now the only question is: Who gets to flip the final switch?
