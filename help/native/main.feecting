Many States, however, observe the fourth Friday in September.

When Columbus discovered the New World there were an estimated 1,100,000 Indians inhabitating the lands north of Mexico, 850,000 livÂ¬ ing in what is now the United States. Wars and disease reduced their numbers to about 250,000 by 1900, but since then the Indian population has increased to 669,000 people in 1970.

In 1974, there were 266 Indian reservations under Federal jurisdiction, ranging in size from tiny settlements in California of only a few acres to the Navajo Reservation of about 14 million acres in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. In recent years the Federal Government has restored additional tracts of land to these native Americans.

Although for hundreds of years the American Indians fought the immigrant settlers, today the Indians have learned that Red Power like Black Power and Grey Power is most effective when working through the democratic processes. American Indians, once so disunited, are begining to find unity among themselves and with their other fellow Americans in the United States.
