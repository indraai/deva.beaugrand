Leaving the Presidio on the 6th, the 402nd MP Battalion motored to Ft. Ord to begin their week of field training.

The MPs had to qualify with the M-16 in day and night fire. The M-60 was also fired for familiarization.

After the rifle qualification, the troops motor marched from Ft. Ord to Hunter Liggett, where they set up a defense position to conduct the Army Training Evaluation Program (ATEP).

The ATEP consists of a number of exercises which include: circulation control, prisoner of war operations, MP station operations, convoy es¬ corts, both day and night, physical security, traffic reconnaissance, control of civil disturbance, patrol of area operations, performance of organizational support activities, rear area protection operation and operating in electronic warfare environments.

“We feel the company training was outstanding and beneficial. Right now, we’re looking forward to the ATEP field problem from the 8th of July through the 15th, at Camp Roberts,” stated Staff Sergeant Ray Beaugrand, NCO of the company.

Special thanks to Fort Ord’s Capt. Krump for help with Hunter Liggett photos.

As the members of the U.S. Army Military Police Corps celebrate their anniversary today, the men and women of the 402nd Military Police Company at the Presidio have something special to celebrate.

The Eagle Trophy comes home today.

Presented to the U.S. Army Forces Command military police unit that is judged to most epitomize the spirit of combat readiness, the presentation of the award this morning at Forces Command Headquarters, Fort McPherson, Georgia marks the second time in the three year history of the award that a Presidio based unit and a company of the 504th Military Police Battalion has won it.

When the award was initiated in Fiscal Year 1974, it was the 170th Military Police Company here that claimed the honor of “Top White Hats.” Last year, the 82nd Military Police Company at Fort Bragg, N.C., took it. This year, the 402nd is returning it to the Presidio.

Commanded by 32-year-old Captain Raymond A. Reass, a Philadelphia, Pa., native, the 402nd participated in activities from up and down the west coast, to Fort Chaffee, Ark. as part of their award winning performance during the past year.

In July, 1975, men of the unit underwent Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) training at Hamilton Air Force Base in California. Also that month, they were on the range for familiarization firing with the 12-gauge shotgun and qualification firing with the .38 and .45 caliber handguns.

From late July through mid-October, the company saw duty at Fort Chaffee, Ark., providing security at the refugee camp established there in support of those who fled Southeast Asia in the wake of the communist takeover.

Returning to their home at the Presidio, they spent the remainder of the month participating in FBI SWAT training again—this time at Tiburon, Ca.

Training tapered off for the holidays, but February saw a 400-mile plus motor march to Fort Irwin, Ca., where the unit was involved in Exercise Bold Eagle—an exercise that showed their ability to operate in desert terrain.

Upon their completion of the exercise at Fort Irwin, the 402nd conducted their annual Chemical - Biological - Radiological (CBR) Proficiency Test. Following that tearful experience, it was back on the Fort Barry range to qualify again with the .38 and .45 caliber handguns.

In June they took to the road again, this time to the range at Fort Ord, Ca., to fire the M-16 rifle and M-60 machine gun. During the same month, they moved on to Hunter Liggett military reservation, south of Fort Ord, to conduct yet another Field Training Exercise (FTX).

When they returned home, they found a physical training (PT) testing waiting for them.

And yet in spite of their heavy training schedule — or perhaps because of it — they were still able to perform the second of their four major missions to the post — that of performing law enforcement/crime prevention activities within the confines of the Presidio and its sub-posts every other month.

The training itself accomplished the first mission — that of being prepared at any time to deploy anywhere in the world.

The third item in the 402nd mission states that they will participate in military funerals, posthumous award ceremonies, honor guards, color guards, and salute batteries. They normally catch these duties during the second two-week period of their training month — the month they are not providing law enforcement support to the Presidio. .

And finally, the men and women of the 402nd Military Police Company are required to be ready to perform a civil disturbance mission within any area of the Continental United States. This activity requires many more hours of strenuous training to develop and maintain peak proficiency.

During the period of time the 402nd was at Fort Chaffee, they also remembered their responsibilities at home by contributing approximately $14,000 to the Combined Federal Campaign last year.

Personal development through the field of education is high on the list of priorities established by Capt. Reass. Presently, nearly 94 per cent of all personnel assigned to the company have high school diplomas. Eight received theirs during Fiscal Year 76 or are presently enrolled at the Education Center for this purpose.

During presentation ceremonies this morning at U.S. Army Forces Command Headquarters, Fort McPherson, Georgia, Captain Raymond A. Reass, commander of the 402nd Military Police Company received the trophy from Colonel A. A. Ackerman, chief of the provost marshal’s law enforcement divi¬ sion.

By golly, the next morning at eight o'clock his secretary called and he said, "Mrs. Fuller, so-and-so signed your plan." I said, "Fine." I took it to the engineer. He was a real good friend of mine and he knew I was causing him a lot of trouble but he signed it anyway. So, I finally got the thing put into print. I took it to the colonel, Colonel Kane. Colonel Kane was extremely pleased and extremely proud.

**Mayor Feinstein assures Presidio of City support**
![Mayor Feinstein assures Presidio of City support](assets/img/1979-01-19-Women-Era-Feinstein.jpg)

San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein early this week acknowledged the City’s official position regarding the proposed closure of the Presidio.

Speaking before the annual awards luncheon of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at the his¬ toric Presidio Officers’ Club, the Mayor candidly announced that she will do everything in her power — even carry a picket sign in front of "A LESSER (important) post in Georgia” (Ft. McPherson) if the decision by DoD officials is to close the Presidio as an active Army installation.

Citing the ties that have bound the City and the military here at the Presidio since the late 1700’s,

Mayor Feinstein expressed anguish at the Department of Defense’s assertion that either a reduction of activities or full closure of the Presidio could achieve fiscal efficiency with taxpayer’s dollars.

The Mayor indicated that while she is certainly in favor of government spending economies, she wants to assure that any closure or realignment decision be based on all available pertinent data, and not simply on what she termed "political cosmetics.” Feinstein assured the capacity crowd of 350 persons attending the CFC luncheon that she is strengthening the Mayor’s Committee to Save the Presidio, a committee of prominent, civicminded business and community leaders organized by the late Mayor George Moscone.

Members of the Mayor’s Committee and City of¬ ficials plan to not only look carefully at every as¬ pect of the Department of Defense study, but to embark upon an independent study of their own. According to the Mayor, she and her committee are going to mount what she identified as "an in¬ telligent and energetic campaign” and she prom¬ ised to "dog it each step of the way.” The Mayor feels confident that her committee will be able to justify retention of the Presidio as an active instal¬ lation. Federal activities located on the Presidio of San Francisco presently help to make this post the largest civilian employer in the City. Should ac¬ tivities here be reduced or shut down altogether, this — according to City officials — would cause an adverse economic impact of great magnitude.

Several years ago, when the City’s Hunter’s Point Naval Shipyard was closed, some 5,500 civilian jobs were lost. If this same fate were to befall the Presidio, San Francisco could expect to lose yet another 3,500 jobs, not including the more than 3,000 military positions located here.
